# Config Maps

ConfigMaps allow you to decouple configuration artifacts from image content to keep containerized applications portable.

You can data from a ConfigMap in 3 different ways.

- As a single environment variable specific to a single key
- As a set of environment variables from all keys
- As a set of files, each key represented by a file on mounted volume
